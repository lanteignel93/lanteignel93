### Research & Case Studies

#### **[Trade Analysis: 1-DTE Weekend Gap](https://github.com/lanteignel93/trade_analysis_example)**
* A quantitative post-mortem of a short-duration volatility strategy. 
* Analyzes theta decay vs. gamma risk exposure, specifically focusing on the PnL variance caused by weekend gap risk.

#### **[Replication Price Sensitivity](https://github.com/lanteignel93/replication_prices)**
* Stress-testing the Black-Scholes model.
* This study quantifies the replication error (PnL leakage) that occurs when theoretical assumptions—specifically continuous hedging and log-normal distribution—are violated by real-world market conditions.
